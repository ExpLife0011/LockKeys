## What is LockKeys ##  
LockKeys is a Windows Explorer extension to show the status of Capslock and Numlock in the TaskBar.

## Why I create the LockKeys? ##  
At ont time, I meet the [Lock Keys](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/36/lock-keys/) a shell extension of GNOME.  
As we all know, it's usually to press the Capslock to input the capital letters.  
With the Lock Keys in the GNOME, you can easyily to see the status of Capslock & Numlock.
But I find the seemly program in the Windows don't meet my requirement which use the notify_icon to realize the function.
So I want to create a seemly extension in the windows.

## How to use the LockKeys? ##  
1. You can download the realse version.
2. Double click the register.bat.(It may require the UAC.)
3. Right click in the TaskBar. Tools -> LockKeys. (It may be you can't see the LockKeys at the first time.The resolve way is to right lick twice.)

## Feature request: ##  
1. Add the Content menu to allow uesr to select the monitor Keys. (one of Capslock & Numlock or both)
2. Add the optional message notification.
